# Transcription-Translation-Calculator
A java GUI application that transcribes and translates a DNA strand into mRNA and protein respectively.

NOTE:
1. You must enter the DNA strand in CAPS (i.e. A, T, C, or G and NOT a, t, c, or g).
2. This calculator only accepts valid DNA strands (i.e. the String must only have A, T, C, and G nucleotides).
3. In order to translate your DNA strand, you must make sure that TAC (when transcribed is AUG-the start codon) exists in your DNA strand.
since a start codon is necessary in an mRNA strand for translation to occur. 
4. The calculator will only translate starting from the start codon. 
4. A stop codon (i.e. ATT, ACT, or ATC in the DNA strand) need not exist in your DNA strand. 

How to run the executable jar files:
